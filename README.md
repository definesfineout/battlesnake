# Snakes who play [Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com/) üêç

Developed live on stream at [twitch.tv/defiines](https://twitch.tv/defiines)

- **SillyBoi** implements naive approaches to survival and finding food
- **Skagit** plans to implement some sort of hamiltonian cycle algorithm before augmenting with flood-fill
- **Sifl** is controlled by human input via gamepad, more sock puppet than snake
- **Olly** will also be gamepad-controlled, but will try to help avoid walls and other snakes

## Classic Algorithmic Approaches
### Hamiltonian Cycle
- [Snake: Hamiltonian Cycle - Literature review](https://kychin.netlify.app/snake-blog/hamiltonian-cycle/)
    - Based largely upon [Efficient solution for finding Hamilton cycles in undirected graphs](https://springerplus.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40064-016-2746-8)
    - Also [Nokie 6110 Part 3: Algorithms by John Tapsell](https://johnflux.com/2015/05/02/nokia-6110-part-3-algorithms/)
        - itself, based upon [Prim's algorithm (Maze Generation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Randomized_Prim's_algorithm)
